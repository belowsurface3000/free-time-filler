A web project for DCI during a one year web development course. The goal was to practice HTML, SASS, &amp; JavaScript: JS Objects, JS Array Methods, DOM Manipulation. My goal was to create a basic website, where users can find inspirations about what to do in their free time. Users will get displayed a random actitiy when the page is loaded first. Then selections may be done, according to interestes, time and money available. Matching activities will be displayed with some text and an image. The user can hit "Next please!" to display anohter activity, until something was found or the suggestions ran empty.

# Used languages
- HTML: a Form Element for user input
- CSS / SASS: Flexbox for positioning, Linear gradient for the background, Media queries for responsiveness
- JavaScript: A nested object for storing the activities, an ES6 Class with a constructor and a few methods to use, DOM Manipulation to receive and change the HTML content, Math methods to pick random activities, .filter() array method to select activities based on the users choices, Event listeners to perform actions on certain events like finished page loading or mouse clicks, map(). array method to perform actions on certain activites, like displaying only the activity name, conditional statements to perform actions based on the users selections, .splice() array method to delete displayed actitivies from the array, so no activity gets displayed more than once.
- Other methods used: indexOf(), .setAttribute(), .join(), .push()
